@text0 The digitization of large quantities of analogue data and the massive production of born-digital documents
for many years now provide us with large volumes of varied multimedia data (images, maps, text, video,
multi-sensor data, etc.), an important feature of which is that they are cross-domain. "Cross-domain"
reflects the fact that these data may have been acquired in very different conditions: different acquisition

systems, times and points of view (e.g. a 1962 postcard from the Arc de Triomphe vs. a recent street-
view acquisition by mobile mapping of the same monument).

These data represent an extremely rich heritage that can be exploited in a wide variety of fields, from
SSH to land use and territorial policies, including smart city, urban planning, tourism, creative media and
entertainment. 
<br>In terms of research in computer science, they address challenging problems related to
the diversity and volume of the media across time, the variety of content descriptors (potentially including
the time dimension), the veracity of the data, and the different user needs with respect to engaging with
this rich material and the extraction of value out of the data. These challenges are reflected in research
topics such as multimodal and mixed media search, automatic content analysis, multimedia linking and
recommendation, and big data analysis and visualisation, where scientific bottlenecks may be
exacerbated by the time dimension, which also provides topics of interest such as multimodal time series
analysis.
<br>
The objective of this workshop is to present and discuss the latest and most significant trends in the
analysis, structuring and understanding of multimedia contents dedicated to the valorization of heritage,
with emphasis on the unlocking of and access to the big data of the past.
